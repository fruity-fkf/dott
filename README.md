> # My dotfiles

These are my dotfiles
They're what I use on my main daily driving system

A ***lot*** of the stuff is stolen from other places

For example the hyprland config is from [link](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots "this guy who did an AMAZING job")

And my neovim config is [LUNARVIM](https://www.lunarvim.org/ "lunarvim")

there's nothing more to say TBH

I'm a guy who steals from other peoples configs
