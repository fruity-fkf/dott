> # My dotfiles

---

These are my dotfiles
They're what I use on my main daily driving system

A **_lot_** of the stuff is stolen from other places

For example the hyprland config is from [ "this guy who did an AMAZING job"](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots)

And my neovim config is [lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/ "lunarvim")

though nowadays I use [Lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/ "lazyvim")

there's nothing more to say TBH

I'm using both kitty and wezterm(depends on my mood)

for a file browser I am using broot which is AMAZING

I'm a guy who steals from other peoples configs deal with it
